    "\n",
    "We can store a value (of different data types: integer and float numbers, strings, data structures) in a variable. We use a variable assignment for it. Let's type something in this format: ```variable_name = value```, where ```=``` is called as assignment operator. If we run this code, Python creates an object for storing this value in memory, it automatically identifies its data type, then it creates a pointer (link) and we can address it by calling the variable name.  We come up with the most appropriate variable name ourselves. When we call a variable's name, we can check what is the value. \n",
